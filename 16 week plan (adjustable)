Week 1 — Build the “EV telemetry core”
Do
Set up microcontroller environment
Read ADC reliably
Print a clean serial telemetry line at ~10–50 Hz
Deliverable
Live telemetry: Vpack, raw ADC, timestamp

Week 2 — Pack voltage measurement (calibrated)
Do
Build a voltage divider + ADC input protection
Calibrate with a multimeter (compute scale + offset)
Deliverable
Logged Vpack(t) that matches your multimeter within ~1–2%

Week 3 — Current sensing + power
Do
Install current sensor in series with battery feed
Handle sensor zero-offset (very important)
Compute P = V * I and energy Wh = ∫ P dt / 3600
Deliverable
Live: V, I, P, Wh

Week 4 — Motor spins + safe wiring
Do
Wire: battery → fuse → switch → current sensor → ESC → motor
ESC throttle from microcontroller (servo PWM)
Add an E-stop that physically kills power
Deliverable
Smooth throttle control from 0 → 20 → 50% without brownouts

Week 5 — RPM sensing
Do
Add Hall or optical RPM sensor
Validate pulses-per-revolution (PPR) and filtering
Deliverable
RPM(t) logged during throttle ramps

Week 6 — Temperature sensing (battery + ESC)
Do
Add 2–3 temperature sensors
Convert ADC → temperature (even if approximate at first)
Deliverable
T_batt(t), T_ESC(t) logged during a 2–3 minute run

Week 7 — “Safety supervisor” logic (EV mindset)
Do
Implement firmware states:
IDLE (safe)
ARMED (ready)
RUN
FAULT
Fault triggers:
undervoltage
overcurrent
overtemp
sensor invalid / disconnected
Fault behavior:
throttle → 0
require manual reset
Deliverable
Demonstrate a controlled fault (e.g., undervoltage threshold) and safe shutdown

Week 8 — Closed-loop speed control (PID)
Do
Implement a speed setpoint mode (RPM target)
PID adjusts throttle
Add anti-windup and throttle clamps
Deliverable
Step response plot: setpoint from 2000 → 3000 RPM and show settling

Week 9 — Load introduction (simple)
Pick ONE easy load:
fan/propeller load (simplest)
friction load (careful with heat)
small generator load (motor driving another motor into resistors)
Deliverable
Compare power draw at same RPM with and without load

Week 10 — Data logging that doesn’t suck
Do
SD card logging or clean CSV over serial
Timestamp everything
Log at consistent rate (e.g., 50–100 Hz)
Deliverable
A CSV file you can plot in Python/Excel:
time, V, I, P, Wh, RPM, temps, throttle, state

Week 11 — Battery sag characterization (very EV-real)
Do
Run repeatable throttle steps
Measure voltage sag vs current
Estimate pack internal resistance: 
R≈ΔV/ΔI
Deliverable
Plot: Vpack vs Ipack (scatter), and estimated resistance

Week 12 — Precharge “concept demo” (simple + instructive)
Do
Add a precharge resistor path + procedure (even if manual)
Show reduced inrush / less connector sparking (if relevant)
Deliverable
Documented startup procedure + measured current transient (if you have a scope; if not, document qualitatively)

Week 13 — Optional inertial dynamometer (stretch, high value)
Do
Add a known inertia disk
Run acceleration tests at fixed throttle
Compute torque and mechanical power from RPM(t)
Deliverable
Plot: Torque vs RPM (estimated) and Efficiency-ish vs RPM

Week 14 — “Drive cycle” experiment (system thinking)
Do
Create a synthetic drive cycle: ramp RPM, hold, coast, repeat
Calculate energy used per cycle
Compare two control strategies:
open-loop throttle
closed-loop speed
Deliverable
Plot: energy used for cycle A vs cycle B

Week 15 — Packaging + wiring harness + safety finish
Do
Put it on a baseplate
Strain relief on wires
Guard spinning parts (seriously)
Label connectors and add a wiring diagram
Deliverable
Clean, demo-ready bench unit

Week 16 — Engineering report + demo video
Deliverable package (portfolio-quality)
GitHub repo:
firmware
wiring diagram
BOM
test procedures
CSV data + plotting scripts
PDF report (5–12 pages is fine):
Requirements
Architecture
Safety approach
Calibration method
Tests + plots
Failures + fixes
Next improvements
