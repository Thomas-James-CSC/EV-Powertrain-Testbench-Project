Core
Microcontroller dev board: ESP32 or Arduino
BLDC motor + hobby ESC (RC-style)
Battery: 3S–6S lithium pack (or a bench supply for early testing)
Current sensor: Hall-effect current sensor (easiest + isolated)
Voltage divider components (resistors) for pack voltage
Temp sensors: NTC thermistors + resistors (or digital temp sensors)
RPM sensor: Hall sensor + small magnet or optical interrupter
SD card module or serial logging to laptop

Safety & wiring
Inline fuse + spare fuses
Real switch rated for current (or an XT-style anti-spark connector)
E‑stop button (kills power)
Proper connectors (XT60/XT90 style), wire (14–18 AWG depending on current)
LiPo-safe charging solution + LiPo bag (if using LiPo)

Tools
Multimeter (required)
Soldering iron + heat shrink (strongly recommended)
Wire stripper/crimper
